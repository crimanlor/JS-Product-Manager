# JS Product manager

This little project implements a simple product manager UI using JavaScript and HTML. It allows the user to add products with details such as name, stock, purchase price, and sale price. Additionally, the added products are displayed in a list on the user interface.

## Current Features

- Add products with details such as name, stock, purchase price, and sale price.
- Display the added products in a list on the user interface.
- Clear the form fields after adding a product.

Upcoming, I am going to implement additional features such as editing and deleting products, as well as adding form validations to ensure data integrity and accuracy.
